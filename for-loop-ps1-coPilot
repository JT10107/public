.SYNOPSIS
    Reads a file and iterates through its lines using a for loop.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script reads the contents of a file and processes each line
    individually using a for loop. It outputs each line with its corresponding
    line number.

.PARAMETER FilePath
    The full path of the file to be read.

.EXAMPLE
    ./Read-FileWithForLoop.ps1 -FilePath "C:\01-test\test.txt"
#>

param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string]$FilePath
)

# Check if the file exists
if (-Not (Test-Path -Path $FilePath)) {
    Write-Host "File not found: $FilePath" -ForegroundColor Red
    exit
}

# Read all lines from the file into an array
$Lines = Get-Content -Path $FilePath

# Iterate through the lines using a for loop
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $Lines.Count; $i++) {
    $CurrentLine = $Lines[$i]
    Write-Host "Line $($i + 1): $CurrentLine"
}
